# MY PORTFOLIO
## About me
My name is Katarzyna Pękala. I am an ambitious and diligent manual QA professional seeking new opportunities to further develop my skills. I am excited to enhance my expertise in both manual and automation testing.
With 3 years of experience as a Project Document Controller, I have gained proficiency in quality assurance for project documentation. Additionally, I also possess one year of experience as a manual QA.
During my previous employment, I served as the sole QA member for two teams: Site and Integration. 

In the Site team, I was responsible for the main sites of SALESmanago, as well as landing pages prepared for the marketing team. Additionally, I prepared site reliability reports on a daily basis using the Pingdom tool.

In the Integrations team, I conducted tests on plugins connecting the SALESmanago app with common e-commerce platforms, including Magento 2, Vtex, PrestaShop 1.7, Shopify, and WordPress-WooCommerce. I verified the correctness of data integrated into the SALESmanago app, depending on the settings of the plugin, which included webhooks, callbacks, cookies, timeouts, etc. To test synchronization of product catalogs and induce errors in plugins, I utilized Postman. Moreover, I had the opportunity to manipulate data in the database (MySQL) through phpMyAdmin, simulating errors and checking validations.

I am currently learning Python in preparation for taking my first steps in test automation.
