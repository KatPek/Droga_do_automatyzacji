# MY PORTFOLIO
#About me
My name is Katarzyna Pękala. I am hard working and detail-oriented person with analytical mindset, who is willing to launch a professional career in software quality assurance. In this portfolio I would like to exhibit my technical skills, which I gained through self-learning. I am determined to prove the skills I have already acquired and keep developing in this field. This is why I am now looking for a junior position in testing.
